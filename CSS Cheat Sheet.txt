Cascading Style Sheet at the most basic level it
indicates that the order of CSS rules matter.

.class
#id
*
element
element, element
element element
element > element
element + element
:hover
:last-child
:last-of-type
:first-child
:first-of-type
!important (not recommended)


What selectors win out in the cascade depends on:
-Specificity
-Importance
-Source Order

/////////////////////////////////////////
IMPORTANT:

The order property is designed to lay the items out in ordinal groups. What this means is that items are assigned an
integer that represents their group. The items are then placed in the visual order according to that integer, lowest values first.
If more than one item has the same integer value, then within that group the items are laid out as per source order.

As an example, I have 5 flex items, and assign order values as follows:

Source item 1: order: 2       Output : Source item 3
Source item 2: order: 3                Source item 5
Source item 3: order: 1                Source item 1
Source item 4: order: 3                Source item 2
Source item 5: order: 1                Source item 4
